the three games: Sliding Tiles, Memory Game, or Mine Sweeper.

iv) Sliding Tiles:
The Sliding Tiles game is a game where the user must order the tiles in order from lowest to highest where the first tile in the top left would
be Tile #1 and the tile in the bottom right would be the Blank tile. The user can only select a tile which has a blank tile
adjacent to it in order to slide the tile, if the user selects a tile which doesn't have the blank tile adjacent to it, it will be
an invalid tap thus must try again. The game impliments autosave (described below) which automatically saves every 4 moves.

v) Memory Game:
The Memory Game is a game where the user must match all the pairs of tiles on the board to complete the game, the user does this by
selecting the first tile with a tap which would reveal an image then would try to find the same tile with that image on the second tap.
If the image on both tiles is the same both tiles will stay flipped then the user proceeds to continue this process until all tiles have been matched
If the image on the tiles are different both tiles will flip back to the blank state and the user would have to pick two tiles again.
The user can only tap tiles that are not flipped.

vi) Minesweeper:
Minesweeper is a classic game where the goal is to discover the location of all the mines without clicking on them. Clicking on a tile reveals a number
that tells you the number of mines in the adjacent tiles. You win the game when you have clicked on all tiles other than the ones that contain mines and
you lose if you click on a mine. The game impliments autosave (described below) which automatically saves every 4 moves.
